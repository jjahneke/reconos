DualThread Demo

Idea: Sequential execution of two different threads in two different slots.
-> thread0 in slot0
-> thread1 in slot1

Expected output for thread0:
	Thread 0 enabled!
	Creating sw_thread0 / hw_thread0
	Starting thread_0
	Got answer from thread_0: 42
	rt_thread: 10 20 30 40 
	main.cc: 10 20 30 40
	Done with thread_0, mem is valid? 1

Expected output for thread1:
	Thread 1 enabled!
	Creating sw_thread1 / hw_thread1
	Starting thread_1
	Got answer from thread_1: 64
	rt_thread: 164 264 364 464
	main.cc: 164 264 364 464
	Done with thread_1, mem is valid? 1

SW threads' output is correct.
Output of HW threads as follows:

Thread0:
	Thread 0 enabled!
	Creating hw_thread0
	Starting thread_0
	Got answer from thread_0: 64
	rt_thread: 164 264 364 464
	main.cc: 10 20 30 40
	Done with thread_0, mem is valid? 0

Thread1:
	Thread 1 enabled!
	Creating hw_thread1
	Starting thread_1
	Got answer from thread_1: 64
	rt_thread: 164 264 364 464
	main.cc: 164 264 364 464
	Done with thread_1, mem is valid? 1
